# Diffusion model running on Kubeflow

With this you can create an endpoint which is kserve.yaml that will host the model from huggingface. 
You can also tweak the app.py file which is the main source code for this repo.
You need to create a notebook and then run the inference.py in that for calling the endpint. 

Note:

Make sure the endpoint is active
